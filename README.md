# Martial-parts
Gamejam with me and a friend. 
Theme: Downgrade


Fight 1v1 locally with a friend using the martial techniques: kicking and punching. Each limb has their own health and will fall off when reduced to zero. Plan your attacks wisely and neutralize your opponent by removing their arms and legs. Finish them off and you will have been victorious! 

All sounds of the players and countdown voice is created from a 3 second clip from South park: https://youtu.be/3RhxyHMs-w8?t=75

The game is developed in Unity and uses animations and colliders to create the attacks. I was amazed how much bones and animations can affect the gameplay and further down the line also create unique mechanics. The kick animation makes the player sink to the ground while doing a split. We used this to create platforms just at the right height so that the player needs to kick to be able to go under and this can be tried on the third map in the game!,
